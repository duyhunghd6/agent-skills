# SAFe Configurations

SAFe provides four configurations scaled to organizational complexity. Choose the smallest configuration that fits your needs.

## Configuration Selection Guide

| Configuration      | Teams                     | People   | Use When                                       |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Essential**      | 5–12                      | 50–125   | Single product, one ART                        |
| **Large Solution** | 12+ across ARTs           | 125–500+ | Multi-ART coordination, cyber-physical systems |
| **Portfolio**      | Multiple ARTs             | 500+     | Strategic alignment across value streams       |
| **Full**           | Multiple ARTs + Portfolio | 1000+    | Largest enterprises needing all levels         |

## Essential SAFe

The foundational configuration. Every SAFe implementation starts here.

**Key Elements:**

- One Agile Release Train (ART) with 5–12 teams
- PI Planning as the central alignment event
- Team and Technical Agility + Agile Product Delivery competencies
- Lean-Agile Leadership

✅ **Do**: Master Essential SAFe before scaling further
✅ **Do**: Ensure all teams within the ART share a common backlog cadence
❌ **Don't**: Skip Essential and jump directly to Portfolio SAFe

**Minimum viable roles:** RTE, Product Manager, System Architect, Scrum Masters, Product Owners, Developers

## Large Solution SAFe

For solutions requiring multiple coordinated ARTs.

**Key Elements:**

- Solution Train coordinating 2+ ARTs and suppliers
- Solution Backlog with Capabilities (larger than Features)
- Solution Architect and Solution Train Engineer (STE) roles
- Pre- and Post-PI Planning events for cross-ART alignment

✅ **Do**: Use when a single ART cannot deliver the full solution
✅ **Do**: Implement Solution Intent as the shared "source of truth"
❌ **Don't**: Introduce Solution Train overhead for a single ART

**Common domains:** Automotive, aerospace, defense, IoT, large enterprise platforms

## Portfolio SAFe

Connects strategy to execution across the entire enterprise.

**Key Elements:**

- Lean Portfolio Management (LPM) function
- Portfolio Kanban for Epic flow management
- Strategic Themes → Portfolio Backlog → ARTs
- Value Stream funding (not project-based)
- Participatory budgeting and Lean governance

✅ **Do**: Use when leadership needs visibility across multiple products/solutions
✅ **Do**: Fund value streams, not projects
❌ **Don't**: Apply Portfolio SAFe if you have only a single value stream

## Full SAFe

Combines all three levels for the largest enterprises.

✅ **Do**: Use only when both large solution coordination AND portfolio governance are needed
❌ **Don't**: Default to Full SAFe — complexity has a cost

## When NOT to Apply

- **Single team**: Use Scrum or Kanban directly
- **2–3 teams**: Consider Scrum-of-Scrums or Nexus before SAFe
- **Organization not ready**: SAFe requires leadership commitment and cultural shift
